### Active Test Caches

The active test caches, the amount of space on their disks, and the content they currently maintain are available at

-   <http://www.metaarchive.org/testcachemonitor>

Access a cache by clicking on the link in the Hostname/Admin column

### Logging into a Test Cache

Members need to request that the IP address of their desktop be added to the Admin Access List of test caches.\
Please contact the [MetaArchive Staff](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/User:Staff)

The Login Credentials are listed at [Credentials](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/Credentials)

### Locating Content in the Test Network

To find the status of archival units that use a particular plugin (plugin prefix) use [archival units list](http://tstmonitor.metaarchive.org/archival_units/list) and enter a (partial) plugin name (replace '.' by '|') and choose 'All' instead of the default 'Problem' list mode.

Alternatively use [archival unit lookup](http://tstmonitor.metaarchive.org/archival_units/status) and enter the desired values for plugin names, base_urls, or other parameters.

Archival units that are part of the [DOC](http://metaarchive.org/conspectoy/archives/find/DOC) archive in the ConspecToy can be listed by looking for all archival units with a plugin prefix of 'doc.plugins'.

### Viewing the Status of an Archival Unit

-   To find which cache preserves a copy of a particular archival units, click on [archival units](http://tstmonitor.metaarchive.org/archival_units/list) in the top row menu and enter
    -   (part of) the collection title the archival unit belongs to
    -   one of the paramter values used by the archival unit
    -   or (part of) the plugin name, with '.' replaced by '|'

[HowToViewAUContent](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/HowToViewAUContent) and [HowToViewAUCrawlStatus](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/HowToViewAUCrawlStatus) explain how to view the status details of an archival unit in the LOCKSS DAemon User interface.

### Test Cache Configuration

All Caches in the test network are configured as follows:

-   Title Database: <http://admin.metaarchive.org/lockss_test/config/lockss.xml>
    -   the Title Database contains all archival units that are marked test or retest in the Conspectus; as well as
    -   selected archival units from the [DOC](http://metaarchive.org/conspectoy/archives/find/DOC) archive in the Conspectus
-   Plugin Repository: <http://admin.metaarchive.org/lockss_test/plugins/>
    -   jar files are regenerated by a cronjob which updates xml files to the latest version that was committed to the trunk of the MetaArchive Subversion Repository
    -   the plugin jar files show their modification dates at the url above, so that plugin developers can check whether a jar file has in fact been updated since a change to its xml was committed
    -   <http://admin.metaarchive.org/lockss_test/plugins/update_log> contains a trace of the script that updates a plugin and jars them for the test network
    -   <http://admin.metaarchive.org/lockss_test/plugins/xml/> contains the currently known test plugins

The title database, plugin jar, and xml files are all updated every 15 min. Test caches update their configurations every 15 min as well, so that in the worst case it takes 30 min for a new plugin or archival unit to be known to a daemon on a LOCKSS test cache. The update script for plugins logs its actions at [lockss_test/plugins/update_log](http://admin.metaarchive.org/lockss_test/plugins/update_log)

### Pushing an AU into the Test Network

Please keep in mind that LOCKSS caches can ONLY understand an archival unit if:

-   it is part of the Title Database; and
-   its plugin is properly configured/updated in the Plugin Repository

Only Archival Units whose status is marked as test or retest in the Conspectus (see [ConspectusHowTo](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/ConspectusHowTo)) become part of the Title Database. Only plugins that are maintained in the trunk of the MetaArchive Subversion Repository are made available, see [Subversion info](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/Subversion). You can see the latest Title Database at the link above. To actually add the AUs to a cache, see [How to add AUs](https://wiki.metaarchive.org/metawiki/index.php/HowToAddAus).
